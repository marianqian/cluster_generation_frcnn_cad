# cluster_generation_frcnn_cad
Based on code and model from Ribli et. al., [Computer aided detection with Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/riblidezso/frcnn_cad). 
TO DO:
- Include raster geometry, py-faster-rcnn repos
- Add calc_data repo (https://github.com/marianqian/calc_data)

**NOTE**: Code here is not located inside Docker containers in `software-requirements`. Demo note book would not run if you clone this repository, you would need to either set up the py-faster-rcnn repo from instructions listed in that specific repo OR follow instructions to use Docker.
